Footnote A immediately strikes me as interesting because it says we have 7 more chapters to read before even discussing the birth of Christ. Coming from an LDS perspective, this obviously means the premortal existence, but it is curious to me that a book purported to be about Christ finishes the first sentence by already distancing itself from standard Christian belief.

I like how footnote C is essentially saying "We are using all the LDS scriptures. If you don't like it, deal with it."

Overall, chapter 1 does exactly what it is titled to do, provide an introduction. It also shows that the author is taking an unabashedly LDS stance when approaching this work rather than a general historical/theological one. Upon reading the chapter, I have not come across anything that strikes me as profoundly against the standard Christian viewpoint and I feel like this introduction could be modified only slightly to act as an introduction to many other books examining Christ.
