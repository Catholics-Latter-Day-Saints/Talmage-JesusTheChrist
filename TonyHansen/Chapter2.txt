7 pages in and we are already quoting the Pearl of Great Price. Chapter 2 started of strong though and has yet to make insane claims that someone unfamiliar with LDS belief would immediately pick out as different from what they believe. Most groups wouldn't say Christ was fore-ordained to be the Saviour, but they also wouldn't argue that Christ was chosen as the Saviour prior to the world being prepared.

Page 8 starts talking more about the premortal existence in ways completely alien to a non-LDS person and confusing if you are unfamiliar with the LDS teachings from the Book of Abraham. But I'm going to copy Talmage and say "See other works that discuss the premortal existence more fully."

I again love the way Talmage approaches the subject of Christ, with straightforwardness and no room for question on what Talmage believes is true. Every time I read this book, I am appreciative of Talmage's simple and direct style to convey things that are truly important to him. He seems to try not to distract the reader with difficult language or many unknown terms. I do wish that he spent a little more time introducing the reader to LDS concepts, but I also understand that this was a book written for an LDS audience and wasn't written as an introductory LDS text but directed to adults who were very familiar with LDS teaching.
